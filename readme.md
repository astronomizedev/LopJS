LopJS is a node application for developing beautiful websites with JSON(basically an interpreter ðŸš€)!

## Getting Started
First, install LopJS;
```
npm install -g lopjs
```

Now, you can run the lopjs command in your command prompt.
```
lopjs [filename].json
```
using `lopjs [filename].json` will save a file in the same directory the command was ran in called `lopjs [filename].html`!

## Creating a website in JSON with LopJS
Every LopJS file requires two main arrays, `imports`, which contains all the files you import, and `uiObjects` which contains all the objects in the website.

an example JSON website would be like this;
```json
[testsite.json]
{
    "imports": {

    },

    "uiObjects": {
        "text": {
            "type": "text",
            "text": "Hello, World!"
        }
    }
}

```

which, when you run the command `lopjs testsite.json` translates it into an HTML file.

 The code from testsite.json converted into html would like this this:
```html

<!-- Page generated by LopJS. -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
    </head>
    
    <body>
        <p>Hello, World!</p>
    </body>
</html>
```
